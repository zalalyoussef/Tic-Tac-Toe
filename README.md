Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI Decision-Making
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an AI opponent with decision-making capabilities.
Using a tree-based minimax algorithm, the AI calculates optimal moves by evaluating possible game
states to compete effectively against a human player. The AIâ€™s decision depth is adjustable, allowing
players to control the game difficulty. This project showcases foundational concepts in artificial intelligence,
game theory, and decision tree algorithms.
